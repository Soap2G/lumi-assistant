description: Use when the user asks how a CERN service or ATLAS / FTS framework operates and the answer should come from canonical operator documentation — HTCondor / lxbatch submission, SWAN session settings and HTCondor pool, CERN Cloud (OpenStack) flavors and quotas, ML@CERN training and serving, ATLAS Athena / ASG / Tier-0 / databases, ATLAS computing and grid production, FTS3 (File Transfer Service) configuration / installation / REST API / messaging / monitoring. Backed by the `cerndocs` MCP (`search_docs` for BM25 search, `fetch_doc` for one page) over 8 indexed sources: atlas-sft, atlas-computing, atlas-databases, batch, cloud, ml, swan, fts. Does NOT cover the `fts-rest-*` CLI itself (use `fts-rest`), Open Data dataset / recid / DOI lookup (use `cern-opendata` or `atlas-opendata`), live job-state inspection (use `reana` or shell tools), or multi-service infra recommendations (use `infra-advisor`). Disambiguator phrase: CERN docs BM25 multi-source.

# cern-docs — canonical CERN service & ATLAS-software documentation lookup

Upstream MCP: https://cern-mkdocs-mcp.app.cern.ch/mcp

This skill is a thin wrapper around the `cerndocs` MCP server. The
server indexes eight CERN docs sites (BM25 cached for 24 h) and pulls
page bodies live from the upstream git repos on demand. Two site
shapes are covered transparently: **MkDocs** (search payload at
`/search/search_index.json`) and legacy **GitBook v2/CLI** (no search
payload — the server walks `SUMMARY.md` and indexes every linked
markdown page).

## When to load this skill

The user wants to know how a CERN service or ATLAS / FTS framework
operates **as documented**. Examples:

- "How do I submit an HTCondor job from lxplus?"
- "What does the SWAN session timeout default to?"
- "Where are the GPU flavors documented in CERN Cloud?"
- "How does ATLAS Athena versioning work?"
- "What endpoints does ml.cern.ch's serving expose?"
- "How is the FTS3 server configured?"
- "What does the FTS3 docs say about OAuth2 token support / S3 / multihop?"

Do NOT load this skill for:

- **Driving the FTS REST CLI** (`fts-rest-transfer-submit`, `fts-rest-whoami`,
  …) → use `fts-rest`.
- **Open Data dataset / recid lookup** → use `cern-opendata`
  (portal records) or `atlas-opendata` (DSIDs, MC metadata).
- **Live job-state inspection** (a *running* REANA workflow, a
  *current* condor job's status) → use `reana` or the shell tools.
- **Composite multi-service infra recommendations** ("what stack
  should I use to do X end-to-end") → use `infra-advisor`.

## Source IDs

The MCP exposes one `source` parameter to route queries to one of
eight indexed sites. Pick the source that matches the user's domain;
when ambiguous, search more than one — each source is its own BM25
index and a wrong-source query can miss a hit silently.

| `source` | Site | Topic | Backend | `fetch_doc`? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `atlas-sft` | atlas-software.docs.cern.ch | Athena, ASG, ATLAS software | MkDocs | ✅ |
| `atlas-computing` | atlas-computing.docs.cern.ch | Tier-0, grid, MC production | MkDocs (gated) | ✅ |
| `atlas-databases` | atlas-databases.docs.cern.ch | COOL, AMI, conditions DBs | MkDocs (gated) | ✅ |
| `batch` | batchdocs.web.cern.ch | HTCondor / lxbatch | MkDocs | ❌ snippets only |
| `cloud` | clouddocs.web.cern.ch | OpenStack, CERN Cloud, GPUs | MkDocs | ❌ snippets only |
| `ml` | ml.docs.cern.ch | ML@CERN, Kubeflow, serving | MkDocs | ❌ snippets only |
| `swan` | swan.docs.cern.ch | SWAN Jupyter sessions | MkDocs | ❌ snippets only |
| `fts` | fts3-docs.web.cern.ch/fts3-docs | FTS3 install / config / REST API / monitoring / messaging | GitBook | ✅ |

The MCP also exposes a `docs://sources` resource that lists the
registered sources at request time — call it if you suspect the source
list has grown beyond the eight above.

## Tool usage

### Step 1 — always: `search_docs`

`search_docs(query, source, limit=10)` — BM25 search. Returns title + URL +
200-char snippet only. **Token-cheap.** Always start here regardless of source.

### Step 2 — source-class dependent

The eight sources split into two classes based on how their content is hosted:

**Class A — Markdown-backed (`atlas-sft`, `atlas-computing`, `atlas-databases`, `fts`)**
The MCP can resolve a search hit's URL back to a `.md` source file in the
upstream repo and fetch it. `fetch_doc` returns full page bodies:

- `fetch_doc(url, mode="outline")` — headings only. Confirm the right page first.
- `fetch_doc(url, mode="sections:<heading>")` — one section; use when the
  question is scoped to a known heading.
- `fetch_doc(url, mode="markdown")` — full page body. Most expensive; use only
  when the question genuinely needs the whole page.

For `fts`, the resolver follows GitBook conventions: `…/docs/overview.html`
resolves to `docs/overview.md`; directory URLs and `…/index.html` resolve
to the matching `README.md`.

**Class B — search-only (`batch`, `cloud`, `ml`, `swan`)**
These sources are hosted outside the GitLab path resolver. `fetch_doc`
returns "No matching source file" for all URLs from these sources.

- Use `search_docs` with a higher limit (`limit=20`) to cast a wider net.
- The 200-char snippet per result is the only retrieval mechanism available.
- When the question is narrow (e.g. a specific config option), rephrase and
  re-run rather than increasing the limit further.
- Cite the public URL from the search hit even when you can't fetch the body.

## Output rules — what makes it into the user reply

- Cite the **public docs URL** that the search hit returned (e.g.
  `https://swan.docs.cern.ch/sessions/` or
  `https://fts3-docs.web.cern.ch/fts3-docs/docs/overview.html`). The
  user can open it.
- Quote the relevant prose from the fetched body inline; do not link
  the user to the MCP URL or to any internal page identifier.
- If the MCP returns a Recovery Guide (auth-gated source with no
  token, unknown source ID), surface the recovery instructions to
  the user verbatim — they are operator-grade help text.

## Example flows

**"How does Athena versioning work?"** (atlas-sft — Class A)
1. `search_docs(query="Athena release versioning", source="atlas-sft")`
2. Pick the top hit, `fetch_doc(url=<hit URL>, mode="outline")` to confirm.
3. `fetch_doc(url=<hit URL>, mode="markdown")` for the full body.
4. Quote the relevant section, cite the URL.

**"How do I configure FTS3 for OAuth2 tokens?"** (fts — Class A, GitBook)
1. `search_docs(query="OAuth2 token configuration", source="fts")`
2. `fetch_doc(url=<hit URL>, mode="outline")` to scout the page.
3. `fetch_doc(url=<hit URL>, mode="sections:Configuration")` for the relevant section.
4. Quote the section, cite the rendered `.html` URL.

**"How do I submit a condor job from lxplus?"** (batch — Class B, search-only)
1. `search_docs(query="submit job from lxplus", source="batch", limit=20)`
2. Extract the answer from snippets; cite the returned URL.
3. If snippets are thin, re-query with a tighter phrase:
   `search_docs(query="condor_submit .sub file lxplus", source="batch", limit=20)`.

**"What's the default SWAN session timeout?"** (swan — Class B, search-only)
1. `search_docs(query="session timeout default", source="swan", limit=20)`
2. Extract from snippets; cite the returned URL.
3. *(fetch_doc is not available for swan — snippets are the ceiling.)*

**Cross-source question** ("compare HTCondor on batch vs SWAN's HTCondor pool"):
run `search_docs` separately against `batch` and `swan`, present both.
Don't let the BM25 ranker silently hide one source.

## Limitation: FTS REST CLI docs

The FTS3 docs index covers the markdown under
`gitlab.cern.ch/fts/documentation/docs/`. The build pipeline of the
upstream site *also* pulls REST CLI / Python-bindings docs from a
separate repo (`cern-fts/fts-rest`) into `fts-rest/docs/` at publish
time — those pages are **not in this MCP's index** (cross-repo
inclusion isn't followed). For REST CLI command syntax, prefer the
`fts-rest` skill (which has the command catalogue and `--help`
output), or fall back to the upstream rendered URL the user can open
in a browser.
